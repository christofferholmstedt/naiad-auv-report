The Naiad Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) was built by 18 M.Sc students from M\"{a}lardalen University, majoring in robotics and intelligent embedded systems in the Robotics project course at  M\"{a}lardalen University, Sweden. \newline
The long term goal of the Naiad AUV project is to create a shoal of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that cooperate to solve a common mission. The mission will consist of cleaning the Baltic sea from toxic waste by finding barrels of such waste that has been dumped in the Baltic sea for decades.
