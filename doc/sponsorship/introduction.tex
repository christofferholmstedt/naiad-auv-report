As head of external relations it has been my job to serve as a contact person towards companies, media and people. In other words, I have been the link between the project group and the outer world. 

The role has involved a series of different tasks; amongst them are for instance to ask companies for sponsoring, to produce material for the webpage and social media pages, to get publicity in media, to arrange with our participation in conferences and to create a crowdfunding campaign. Every action taken has been in line with a goal of gathering more money to the project - and that is what this role is all about.
