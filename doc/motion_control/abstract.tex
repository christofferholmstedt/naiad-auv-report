This report will cover the motion control system for the Naiad AUV platform developed during the fall of 2013 at M\"alardalens University. The Naiad AUV is an autonomous underwater vehicle developed as a research platform for the RALF III research project at M\"alardalens University. The purpose of the Naiad AUV is to be able to locate and salvage toxic waste in the baltic sea. The motion control system for the Naiad AUV has its basis in six PID controllers, one for each component of the crafts current orientation and position. These will produce control values for each of the six thrusters that propels the craft. This system is built as a layered software system where modularity and maintainability is in focus. The result is a fully functional control system for the Naiad AUV that is very reliant on calibration of each individual PID controller.
