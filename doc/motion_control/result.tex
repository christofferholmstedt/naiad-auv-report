\section{Result}\label{sec:result}

The current implementation yielded a system that is very reliant on calibration as with all PID based control systems. Without proper calibration and configuration of the different PID controllers the system will not behave in a desired way. 

Since the Zeiger-Nichols method did not prove to be a reliable tuning method for this system one had to use manual tuning and through trial and error find a correct configuration configuration for each component.

Since all the tests for this system was done in a simulated enviroment one can not be sure if the current configuration will suffice in a real enviroment. But with the tests done in the simulated enviroment a proof of concept for the structure and implementation could be presented.
