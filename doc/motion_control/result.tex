\section{Result}\label{sec:result}

The current implementation yielded a system that is very reliant on calibration as with all PID based control systems. Without proper calibration and configuration of the different PID controllers the system will not behave in a desired way. 

The Zeiger-Nichols method \cite{web:zeiger-nichols}  did not prove to be a reliable tuning method for this system, manual tuning with trial and error as a strategy was used to find a usable configuration for each component in the system.

Since all the tests for this system was done in a simulated enviroment it is not certain if the current configuration will suffice in a real enviroment. However with the tests done in the simulated enviroment a proof of concept for the structure and implementation could be presented.
