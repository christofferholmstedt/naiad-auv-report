This system is very reliant on the calibration of the system in question. Without proper calibration and configuration of the different PID controllers the system wont behave in a desired way. Since the Zeiger-Nichols method did not give sufficient results we have not found a scientific method on calibrating the system. We had to use manual tuning and through trial and error find a correct configuration on each component.


With this implementation we have created a stable and reliable motion control system. And with the current structure it is easy to understand and follow the flow of data. 

With correct calibration one can place the craft in any orientation and move toward
