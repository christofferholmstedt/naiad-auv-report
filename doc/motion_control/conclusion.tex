\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

With this implementation we have created a stable and reliable motion control system. And 

With the current structure it is according to the authors easy to understand the codebase and to follow the flow of data through the system. With the successive breakdown of the location of the craft into its components it is easy to understand how the system preforms its calculations and retreives the next sequence of control values to the thruster controllers.

With the component based class structure a maintainable system with extensive unit testing has been written. And with this in mind the authors can confidently say that they have created a stable and reliable system that fulfills it purpose.

With correct calibration one can place the craft in any orientation and move towards the currnet setpoint. This is according to the authors very good since one is able to use all 6 degrees of freedom and if the craft got weighted down in some way it would compensate for that so transporting objects without loosing control of the craft is possible.
