\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
There are many benefits using pneumatics instead of an electric  system; decreased power consumption, less electromagnetic interference, fewer electric components exposed in the water.

The mechanical parts of the pneumatic system were precisely engineered in such a way that conform with Naiad's unique design, space and weight requirements. The pistons (and consequently the other components) were chosen to be as small as possible but still can provide the required actuation characteristics (force, length, speed).

In order to estimate the required gas supply. Smaller components have the benefit of reduced gas consumption, which in turn equals to smaller gas tank and longer run time.

The pistons are driven by pneumatic valves that are controlled by a Generic Can Controller. This controller is receives commands from the can bus and activates the appropriate valve.
