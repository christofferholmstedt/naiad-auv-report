\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
An actual system has to be build in order to further develop the pneumatics system. Problems might arise that can be only discovered through testing. For example the torpedo mechanism might require an unacceptably large amount of gas to operate, or it might disturb the balance of the robot during launching. In order to solve such unforeseen problems it might be necessary to partially or completely redesign the affected components.
