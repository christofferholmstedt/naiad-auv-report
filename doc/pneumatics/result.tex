At the time of this writing none of the mechanics have been manufactured due to limited financial resources, and consequently not tested in real life. Since all the components have been designed and tested in SolidWorks, it is likely that the performance will be at least satisfactory and only small improvements (if any) will be needed. The Generic CAN Controller has been thoroughly tested through unit tests, but also in real life. The correct action was observed for any input value, and also undefined messages were rejected.
