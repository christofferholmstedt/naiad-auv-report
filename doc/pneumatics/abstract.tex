\begin{abstract}
The Naiad AUV is capable of interacting with the environment using sensors and actuators. One of the short term goals of the prototype is to compete in the RoboSub\cite{web:robosub}, thus the current system is adapted according to the competition's mission requirements. There are two torpedo launchers, two markers, and two grippers. All the actuators are pneumatic-operated and are driven by separate and independent valves. The pneumatics system is controlled by a Generic CAN Controller, running the firmware written for this task.
