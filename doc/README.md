To project members
==================
The final report from Project Naiad will be a combination of several topic
specific reports that are combined into one large PDF. Each report will include
the following parts:

 * Abstract
 * Introduction
 * Method / Approach
 * Implementation
 * Results
 * Conclusion
 * References
 * Appendices (Optional)

### How to get started

 1. Copy "template" directory and rename it to your topic e.g.
"mission\_control\_system" or "imu" (only lower-case characters and
underline).
 2. Edit the "sigproc-sp.tex" file.
   1. Fix number of authors.
   2. Add your name(s) and email(s).
   3. Fix the title (it's the <subject> part).
 3. Start to write your report.

### References are collected in the same bib file
To make sure that all our references look the same we will use a single
references.bib file. It's located in the "doc" folder (one folder above the
main tex-file for your report. If you add new references please push the
updates to the master branch immediately. This is to prevent multiple
references additions for the same reference.
