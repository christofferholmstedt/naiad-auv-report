\begin{abstract}
    This report elucidates the hardware used in the vision system of the AUV Naiad and the firmware associated with it. The vision system facilitates detecting objects of various shapes and colours using its high resolution image sensors. The operating system used in the vision system hardware is Linux and the system interacts with other devices in the robot through a CAN bus. The challenges faced by the team in achieving the requirements like coding in ADA, using state of the art products in embedded systems like hard processors are also mentioned in the report.
