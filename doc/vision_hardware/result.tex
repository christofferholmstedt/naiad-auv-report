When the GIMME-2 board is powered with 12V, the device boots up and the booting sequence can be observed through the serial terminal. The team used \textit{gtkterm} in a Linux host for interacting with the device. 

The image processing files stored on the memory card are tested successfully on the GIMME-2 board. Core affinity to the image processing tasks are assigned and the functionalities are executed in parallel by exploiting the dual-core processor.

The CAN module is also tested by using the Kvaser CAN interface cable connected to a PC. The baud rate is set and messages are sent and received successfully over the CAN bus. Message filtering is also tested successfully by screening a set of message IDs.
