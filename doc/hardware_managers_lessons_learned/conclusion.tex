\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Project courses such as the Robotics Project course are good since they lets each student use his/her skills in a realistic context, cooperate with others and do something that has not been done before. Because of this it is important each student has a solid base of skills in his/her area(s) before starting such a project and that cooperation within the project group works well.
