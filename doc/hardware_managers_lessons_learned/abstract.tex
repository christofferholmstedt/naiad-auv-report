\begin{abstract}
In the beginning of the Naiad AUV Project I was assigned to be the manager of hardware development during the project. In this report I have written down my experiences and what I learned. My intended readers are primarily future students of the Robotics project course but also anybody else who participates in projects, primarily student projects, that include many people and span over longer times. \newline
This report is written solely at my initiative and is, at the time of writing, not officially a part of the body of subreports from the Naiad AUV project. For these reasons I go against common practise by writing in first-person narrative. I do this in order to emphasise that the thoughts and opinions expressed in this reports are mine and mine only. \newline
I have written this report in English as opposed to Swedish since I want anyone, including exchange students for example, to be able to read it.
