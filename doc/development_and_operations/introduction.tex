\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
For every project that has some part of development there is most of the time a development
process to follow. As project teams grow bigger and bigger the development
process gets more important. For the Naiad project we were 18 students and most
of us did some development. In close relation to the development comes
operations, this includes the installation and management of the Naiad
website (wordpress, mysql and backup procedures).

This report will start of with lessons learned from the development
process and continue on with lessons learned from operations. The conclusion
section in the end will list the most important improvements that can be made
in the next year project.
