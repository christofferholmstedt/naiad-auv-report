\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
I, the author, have been the project manager for the project known as Naiad. My role will be easier to understand if you look at the supposed hierarchy of the project, Fig \ref{fig:hierarchy}.

So basically my role has been to act as the glue that keeps everything together. Making sure that the client's wishes are met, report progress to the supervisor and bridge the gap between the software and  the hardware part by communicating with their respective managers.
