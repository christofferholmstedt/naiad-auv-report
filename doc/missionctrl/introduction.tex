\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
During the design of the mission control system, a set of requirements were established. Missions for Naiad should be easy to create, preferably without having to write any code. Missions should be executed on the mission control system in concurrance with any other tasks performed by the mission control system. Missions should be transmitted to the mission control system through the umbilical chord.

% You can use how many "subsections" and "subsubsections" you like.
\subsection{Limitations}
The mission control system had to be developed in Ada. The system should operate under the restrictions of the ravenscar profile. Both of these limitations are specific requirements requested by the client.
