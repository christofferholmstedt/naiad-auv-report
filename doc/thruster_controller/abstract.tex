   Every vehicle, by definition has a propulsion system which allows it to move. In the case of most AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) the propulsion system consists of one or more thrusters. In the "Naiad project" a number of 6 thrusters were used to allow the vehicle to move underwater in all three planes X, Y and Z, same as the "Vasa project" \ref{â€¢} which is an earlier AUV developed by a group of students at M\"{a}lardalen University, Sweden. For the "Naiad project" a different configuration of the thrusters than the "Vasa project" was chosen to allow it to be more agile.
