\section{Result}\label{sec:result}
The results from the Motor Controller System have been good although not many tests have been performed on the hardware, especially the thrusters delivered late due to the lack of funds. The CAN communication have been tested thoroughly and the results were good. The generation of the PWM signal has been tested on the Generic CAN controller and the results were good. The brushless speed controller has also been tested and the results came out fine. Naiad's thrusters were also tested although not as much as other parts of the system.

 A demo has been set up and the thrusters were successfully tested. One problem that might occur have and should be taken into consideration is that the thrusters were tested in air and  that the first speed were they start spinning, the rotation seems to be a little faster but hopefully the friction between the water and propeller will make them spin slower so that the robot can maintain a smooth still position. Since they were not tested together underwater, adjustments and calibrations will be needed.
