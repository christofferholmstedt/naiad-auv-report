\section{Result}\label{sec:result}
The results from the Motor and Motors Controller System have been good although not many tests have been performed on the hardware especially the thrusters because they have been delivered lately due to the lack of funds. The CAN communication have been tested thoroughly and the results were good. The generation of the PWM signal has also been tested on the Generic CAN controller and the results were good. The brushless speed controller has also been tested and the results came out fine. Naiad's thrusters were also tested although not as much as other parts of the system.

 A demo has been set up and the thrusters were successfully tested. A problem that might occur have to be taken into consideration is that the thrusters were tested in air and and the first speed when they start spinning the rotation seems to be a little faster but hopefully the friction between the water and propeller will make then spin slower and so that the robot can maintain a smooth still position .Since they were not tested together and underwater adjustment and calibrations will have to be made to the system.
