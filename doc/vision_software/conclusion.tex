\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Future work:


Testing
The system can be tested fully using integration, unit tests, acceptance tests. These would have to be wrote manually as the test suite a-unit cannot be used with the bindings.

Integrating disparity maps with velocity estimator func
the disparity map can be integrated with the velocity estimator function to recieve the estimated distance in centimeters instead of estimated pixels.

Integrating Can to the system
The can controller for the gimme2 has been completed by the vision firmware team. this code must be added to the vision software system main file.

Instruction handling system
A system for handling messages from mission control must be implemented.

PCL

-euclidean segmentation
a Euclidean segmentation module can be implemented to segment planes in a point cloud. 

-triangulation mesh
constructing a triangular mesh around the point cloud, effectively turning the pointcloud from a group of points to a reconstructed surface can be implemented.

-coloring in mesh
The reconstructed triangular mesh can then be “colored in” using the color intensity values from the original stereo images.
