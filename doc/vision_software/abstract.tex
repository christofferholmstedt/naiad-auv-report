\begin{abstract}
    This report documents the work completed by the vision system software team of project Naiad at M\"{a}lerdalens H\"{o}gskola in V\"{a}ster\r{a}s, Sweden. The authors were M.SC. students in the final year of an Intelligent Embedded Systems course. The team's goal was to create the vision system software for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) as part of the ``Project in Advanced Embedded Systems" course, to enable it to participate in the RoboSub and SAUC-E competitions.
\\The software was developed to effectively search and locate items with a known description or some specified attribute. It can also map a pair of stereo images to a point cloud and additionally can estimate the velocity of the AUV using stereo images. 
\\The system was primarily developed using the Ada programming language, to introduce safety critical features to the system. 
The system was completed to be a real time visual perception unit with object detection and recognition features.
