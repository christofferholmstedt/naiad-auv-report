\section{Result}\label{sec:result}
The software developed for the vision system using OpenCV was run on the GIMME-2 using datasets as inputs for the modules as the GIMME-2 is as of now not does not show consistent and acceptable performance in capturing images. 

The PCL software was not tested on GIMME-2 due to timing constraints, but it was tested on the Pandaboard and hence, should run on the GIMME-2 without any problem.

Some images for the tests can be found in the appendix \label{vision_appendix_A} .
