The results section of this report is divided by sensor.

\subsection{Temperature sensor}
A small PCB prototype which contains the converter circuit was built and connected to the temperature sensor and the Generic CAN controller. The tests results were very good. The entire temperature range was not tested, only from +15 degrees Celsius to +100 degrees Celsius due to the lack of equipment to create the rest of the temperature range, but for this range the sensor performed very well. 

\subsection{Pressure sensor}
Due to time limits the pressure sensor was never put through any major tests. A simple test was done where it was connected to a voltage source and its output voltage measured. The result from this test was good. However, more testing and calibration will be needed.

\subsection{Salinity sensor}
Since the salinity sensor was never purchased, no results regarding it was ever obtained.
