<TO BE FILLED IN ONCE MORE TESTING HAS BEEN DONE>

\subsection{Temperature sensor}
A small PCB with the converter circuit has been made and connected to the temperature sensor and the Generic CAN controller. The tests results were very good. Not all temperature range of the sensor was tested, only from +15 degrees Celsius to +100 degrees Celsius due to the lack of equipment to create the rest of the temperature range, but for this range the sensor performed very well. 

\subsection{Pressure sensor}
