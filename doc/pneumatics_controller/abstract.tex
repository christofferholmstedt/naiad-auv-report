\begin{abstract}
Naiad is capable of interacting with the environment using sensors and actuators. One of the short term goals of the prototype is to compete in the RoboSub, thus the current system is adapted according to the competition's mission requirements; there are two torpedo launchers, two markers, and two grippers. All the actuators are pneumatic-operated and are driven by separate and independent valves. The pneumatics system is controller by a Generic Can Controller, running the firmware written for this task.
