\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
One of the core requirements of Naiad was to have a system of actuators. It was decided to be pneumatically-powered . The main benefit compared to an electric system is less electrical components in the water. less power consumption, more actuating power, less electromagnetic interference.

Available space and weight are always limited resources on an AUV, and therefore the most important decision factor was to have the smallest components possible that can provide the required actuation characteristics (force, length, speed). Smaller size equals reduced gas consumption requirements which in turn equals to smaller gas tank.
