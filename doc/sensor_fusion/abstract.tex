\begin{abstract}
   The Sensor Fusion is done on a BeagleBone Black which take care of
   computational heavy calculations. Data is recieved from
   both an ethernet connection and a CAN bus connection. The data is recieved as
   CAN messages independent of underlying technology in the current AUV design.
   For long term maintainability of the code the sensor fusion code is divided
   into seven Ada tasks where each task has a specific responsibility.
