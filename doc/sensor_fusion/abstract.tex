\begin{abstract}
   The Sensor Fusion is done on a BeagleBone Black which dedicate computational
   heavy calucations to dedicated hardware for the task. Data is recieved from
   both a ethernet connection and a CAN bus connection. The data is recieved as
   CAN messages independent of underlying technology in the current AUV design.
   For long term maintainability of the code the sensor fusion code is divided
   into seven tasks where each task has a specific responsibility.
