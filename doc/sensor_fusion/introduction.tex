\subsection{Software architecture}
The responsibiltiy of the Sensor fusion was from the beginning unclear. The design
choices that were made had to leave room for change in responsibility.
This could mean that the calculations that were supposed to be done later on were
more computational heavy than first anticipated or perhaps, the other way around.
It was also important to make sure that the ethernet connection nor the CAN bus
connection were blocking the Sensor fusion calculations.
 
\subsection{Sensor fusion calculations}
The Sensor fusion calculations are aimed to calculate the attitude (yaw, pitch and roll) of the AUV and also the position of the AUV in x,y and z co-ordinates taking the starting position as the origin. Due to the time constraints and the financial constraints because of which the order of IMU was delayed, the Sensor fusion was never implemented. However the document is meant to guide the readers in the right direction and help them avoid the mistakes.
