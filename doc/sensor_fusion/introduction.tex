\subsection{Software architecture}
The responsibiltiy of the Sensor fusion was from the beginning unclear. The design
choices that were made had to leave room for change in responsibility.
This could mean that the calculations that were supposed to be done later on were
more computational heavy than first anticipated or perhaps, the other way around.
It was also important to make sure that the ethernet connection nor the CAN bus
connection were blocking the Sensor fusion calculations.
