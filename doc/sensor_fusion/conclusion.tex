\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The conclusions of this report are divided into 
Software architecture and Sensor fusion calculations.

\subsection{Software architecture}
The software design of Sensor fusion meets the requirements set out in the
beginning and make room for future improvements with the use of Ada Tasks
in a modular way. It is also easy to change the actual algorithm used for the
sensor fusion calculation as it's placed in one single Main task. The one main
issue that can be improved with regard to the software architecture is how
the filtering tasks filter the CAN messages by ID, at the moment it's just an
if-statement for specific IDs and should be improved.

% You can use how many "subsections" and "subsubsections" you like.
\subsection{Sensor fusion calculations}
The Sensor fusion calculations never reached the implementation
stage because of the delay in arrival of IMU and FOG. However a lot
of brainstorming was done in reaching the solutions to the problems presented.
This report serves the purpose to point the people interested in the
project in the right direction.
