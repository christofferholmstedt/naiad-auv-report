\subsection{Software architecture}
The software design of Sensor fusion meets the requirements set out in the
beginning and make room for future improvements with the use of Ada Tasks
in a modular way. It is also easy to change the actual algorithm used for the
sensor fusion calculation as it's placed in one single Main task. The one main
thing that can be improved with regard to the software architecture is how
the filtering tasks filter the CAN messages by ID, at the moment it's just an
if-statement for specific IDs and should be improved.
