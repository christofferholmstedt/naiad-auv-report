A requirement for the Naiad AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) is to have a passive broadband sonar. Also according to the mission specifications of the ROBOSUB competition the AUV is required to listen to a pinger and locate its position. All these functionalities can be implemented using an array of hydrophones. For the Naiad AUV, 4 hydrophones arranged in a rectangular array were used. The Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) technique was used to accurately locate the pinger. \newline
	The multilateration algorithm takes the time of arrival of the signal at each hydrophone as input and calculates the position of the pinger. A CAN message is sent containing the relative position of the pinger in 3 dimensions.
