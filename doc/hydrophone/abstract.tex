A requirement for the AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) was to have a passive broadband sonar. Also according to the mission specifications of the ROBOSUB competition the AUV is required to listen to a pinger and locate its position. All these functionalities can be implemented using an array of hydrophones. For this AUV, 4 hydrophones arranged in a rectangular array were used. The Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) technique is used to accurately locate the pinger. \newline
	The multilateration algorithm takes input the time of arrival of signal at each hydrophone and calculates the position of the pinger. A CAN message is sent containing the position of pinger in 3 dimensions.
