	Any Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) such as Naiad AUV is independently on accurate information to locate an object via receiving sounds vibration in order to perform their mission.   

   A hydrophone one of the device that used a microphone for recording sound under the water, all hydrophone based on idea of piezoelectric transducer that produce electricity signal when it effected to a pressure change .

   The sound is a pressure wave that effect on the hydrophone itself. The sound signal that received will process in hydrophone circuit and send it via CAN messages to micro-controller to take action on it.
       
This way hydrophone get capability to communicate with main micro controller using CAN messages and perform the mission requirement in probable way.
