As mentioned in the previous sections, due to financial constraints and unavailability of the hardware, the complete system was never tested. However the implementation of the multilateration code in Ada was tested by supplying it values for the time it takes for the sound to reach the hydrophones. The values of the times were obtained from the simulation which was done in MATLAB. The multilateration code in Ada was able to locate the sound source. The accuracy of the location depends on the resolution of the clock used to measure the time at each hydrophone.
