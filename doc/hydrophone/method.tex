\section{Method}\label{sec:method}
The method used for finding pinger location is called multilateration. It uses the difference in time at which the signals arrive at each hydrophone to localize the sound source. With the use of 2 hydrophones the location is narrowed down to a hyperboloid. With one additional hydrophone we get one more hyperboloid and the intersection of the two hyperboloid helps us narrow down the location of pinger to a curve. With one more hydrophone we are able to get another unique curve and the intersection of the two curves gives us the exact location of the sound source. The x,y and z co-ordinates of the pinger are calculated considering one of the hydrophone as the orign.\newline
The derivation for the formulas was done first for the simplest case of hydrophones array, that is the hydrophones are arranged in a square. However due to the design constraints of the AUV, the hydrophones could only be placed in a rectangle. Hence the formulas were derived for the x,y and z co-ordinates of the sound source. After that the formulas were simplified so as to avoid float errors. Hence all the quantities are calculated as numerator and denominator and divided in the end.\newline
The inputs to the formulas are:\begin{enumerate}
\item Length and width of the rectangular array of hydrophones.
\item Velocity of sound in water.
\item Time of arrival of signal at each hydrophone.
\end{enumerate}
