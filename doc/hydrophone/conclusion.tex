\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
Due to limitations presented in the report, hydrophone circuit was not tested. Multilateration software was tested in Ada on PC. Simulations showed that the 16MHz clock of AT90CAN128 is not fast enough to get desired accuracy in multilateration algorithm. \newline
Future work includes designing the hydrophone circuit with a faster microcontroller with atleast 1GHz clock frequency. The API for multilateration algorithm can then be used in the code for that microcontroller.
