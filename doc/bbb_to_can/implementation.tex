The implementation has the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
   \item { \em The UART drivers for the AT90CAN128 microcontroller} \newline This part is described in the AT90CAN drivers report.
   \item { \em The CAN drivers for the AT90CAN128} \newline This part is described in the AT90CAN drivers report.
   \item { \em Conversion between CAN message and strings of bytes } \newline This is implemented in the Can\_Utils project.
   \item { \em The UART drivers for BeagleBone Black} \newline This part is described in the BeaglBone Black drivers report.
   \item { \em Interface code for the BBB} \newline This is implemented in the BBB\_Can project.
   \item { \em The main program on the AT90CAN128} \newline This is implemented in the AT90CAN\_Uart\_To\_Can project.
\end{itemize}

The hardware filters in the CAN AT90CAN128 microcontroller are set to receive all CAN messages sent on the CAN bus, i.e. no filtering will be used. The reasoning for this is the following: 
If not all messages would be to be forwarded to the BBB, the information about which messages that are to be forwarded would need to sent from the BBB to the Generic CAN controller over UART. This could of course be done but it would make the communication protocol much more complicated.


\subsection{Protocol}
The protocol for sending CAN messages over UART is made as simple as possible to maximize performance (number of CAN messages that can be sent per second). There are mainly four pieces of information in each CAN message: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item { Whether the message uses extended (29 bits) or normal (11 bits) message IDs} 
   \item { The length (number of bytes) of the payload} 
   \item { The message ID}
   \item { The payload of the message}
\end{itemize}

Each message is encoded in the form of a header of five bytes followed by the payload of zero to eight bytes. The first byte of the header includes the length of the message which is put in the four least significant bits. The fifth least significant bit is set to 1 if the message is extended and 0 if it isn't. 
The following four bytes of the header represents the message ID. 
After the header follows the payload bytes (if any). \newline
Please note that no "start of message" or "end of message" flags are used.

\emph{Please note:} This protocol is dependent on the number of bytes being precisely correct. If even one byte more or less than expected is sent, the offset caused by this will cause the the sender and receiver will become unsynchronized and the whole communication will be compromised. The same will happen if one or several bytes are lost due to a receive buffer overflowing for example. \newline

%\subsection{Conversion between CAN message and bytes}
Since conversions between CAN message and bytes would be done on both the BeagleBone Black, the Generic CAN controller and also in the Simulator, this functionality was put into the Can\_Utils \emph{project}. \newline
The Can\_Utils project has three functions: Message\_To\_Bytes, Bytes\_To\_Message\_Header and Bytes\_To\_Message\_Data.  \newline
When converting bytes to a CAN message one will not know the length of message. Therefore one first needs to receive the bytes representing the the header, convert them to the header of the message in order to learn the length of the payload data and then read as many bytes as the payload contained. \newline
For this reason there are two procedures Bytes\_To\_Message\_Header and Bytes\_To\_Message\_Data.  \newline
When converting a CAN message to bytes, one already knows the length of the message and consequently the whole conversion can be done in one procedure, Message\_To\_Bytes.

\subsection{Interface code for the BeagleBone Black}
The BBB\_Can project uses the UartWrapper to send and receive data on the UART. BBB\_Can provides three procedures: \emph{Init}, \emph{Send} and \emph{Get}. \newline
\emph{Init} simply initiates the UartWrapper. \newline
The \emph{Send} procedure takes a CAN message as an argument, it calls the \emph{Message\_To\_Bytes} procedure in \emph{CAN\_Utils} to get a string of bytes representing the CAN message and writes these bytes to the UART buffer using UartWrapper. \newline
The \emph{Get} function has three out parameters: \emph{msg} (the CAN message received), \emph{bMsgReceived} (a boolean value set true if a CAN message was received) and \emph{bUARTChecksumOK} (which is obsolete and should not be read). 

The \emph{Get} procedure reads as much data that there is in the UART receive buffer and puts it a separate software buffer. The reason for this separate software is that the UartWrapper does not provide a function for getting the number of bytes in the receive buffer without reading all available bytes. \newline
If there is enough data in the software buffer, the header of the message is read and converted to a CAN message. Given this, the number of bytes in the message payload is known and the remaining bytes are read from the software buffer. If not all payload bytes have been put into the software buffer, more data is read from the UART receive buffer until enough bytes can be read. The procedure will then return with the received CAN message and \emph{bMsgReceived} set true. \newline
If not enough data for a full header has been received the procedure will return with \emph{bMsgReceived} set false, \emph{msg} will then be undefined and shall not be read.


\subsection{Main program running on the Generic CAN controller}
The main program running on the Generic CAN controller is is called AT90CAN\_Uart\_To\_Can and has two main procedures:

\begin{itemize}
   \item { \em Handle\_Uart}
   reads CAN messages from the UART receive buffer and writes them to the CAN send buffer
   \item { \em Handle\_Can}
   reads CAN messages from the CAN receive buffer and writes them on to the UART send buffer to the BBB
\end{itemize}

Since this program is single threaded it will alternate between these tasks. \newline 
As mentioned, the protocol for the communication over UART is critically sensitive to an overflow in the receive buffer. For this reason, the Handle\_Uart procedure has priority and will handle all CAN messages in the buffer and only return when no more messages have been received. Handle\_Can will only handle one message, if any message is present in the CAN receive buffer. \newline
This way any overflow i BBB to CAN subsystem will only be in one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
   \item { \em The send buffer of the BBB} \newline
   If the BBB writes to its send buffer at a higher rate than the UART connection can send.
   \item { \em The CAN send buffer} \newline
   If the main program tries to send messages at a higher rate than it can send, for example due to high CAN bus utilization.
   \item { \em The CAN receive buffer} \newline
   If CAN messages are received from the CAN bus at a higher rate than what the main program can read, for example if the   BBB is sending CAN messages at a high rate.
\end{itemize}

In the first case is easily avoided by making sure the BBB does not send CAN messages at a faster rate than the BBB to CAN subsystem is capable of. The second and third cases will only cause individual CAN messages to be lost rather than compromising the communication protocol between the BBB and the Generic CAN controller.
