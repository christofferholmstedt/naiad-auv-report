\begin{abstract}
    Each BeagleBone Black board need to communicate over the CAN bus. This is implemented using the Generic CAN controller which is a piece of hardware that is used in many roles throughout the project. The BeagleBone Black will communicate with the Generic CAN controller over UART. The Generic CAN controller receives the CAN messages from the UART and sends them on the CAN bus. When a CAN message is sent by another node on the CAN bus the Generic CAN controller will receive it and send it over UART to the BeagleBone Black. \newline
    This way the BeagleBone Black get the capability to send and receive CAN messages. This capability is vital to the success of the Naiad AUV project because of the central role played the BeagleBone Black boards and the CAN bus in the design of the Naiad AUV.
