    Several BeagleBone Black boards were used in the system for various tasks (the Mission control or the Sensor fusion for example). Each board needs to communicate over the CAN bus, something that is not supported directly by the hardware. This problem was solved by using the Generic CAN controller which is a piece of hardware that is used in many roles throughout the project. The BeagleBone Black communicates with the Generic CAN controller over UART. The Generic CAN controller receives the CAN messages from the UART and sends them on the CAN bus. When a CAN message is received from the CAN bus, the Generic CAN controller will send it over UART to the BeagleBone Black.\newline
    This approach enables the BeagleBone Black to send and receive CAN messages, something vital for the success of the Naiad AUV project because of the central role of the BeagleBone Black boards and the CAN bus in the design of the system.
