The results from the BeagleBone Black to CAN subsystem have been very good. The subsystem has been tested and used extensively throughout the course of the project and has worked well. \newline
The potential problem with the protocol being offset (too few or to many bytes being sent) has not been found to occur at any time. Nor have there been any cases of CAN messages being lost in the BBB to CAN subsystem. \newline
There exists no known case of data being corrupted during the transmission over UART.
