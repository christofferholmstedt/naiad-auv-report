The results from the BBB to CAN subsystem have been very good. It has been tested and used extensively throughout the course of the project and has worked well. \newline
The potential problems with the protocol being offset (too few or to many bytes being sent) have not been found at any time. Nor have there been any cases of CAN messages being lost in the the subsystem. \newline
There has been no known case of data being corrupted during the transmission over UART.
