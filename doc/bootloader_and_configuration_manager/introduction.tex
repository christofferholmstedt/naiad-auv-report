\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The customer gave two requirements for how to handle the firmware.

The first was that the firmware should be downloaded via the CAN-bus. The second stated that the firmware should be handled by a configuration manager.

The customer suggested programming the microcontrollers with a bootloader that can download firmware via the CAN-bus. The AT90CAN128 microcontrollers that are used have good support for bootloaders so that is the method that has been chosen to update the firmware.
