\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The customer gave us two requirements for how to handle the firmware.

The first is that the firmware should be downloaded via the CAN-bus. The second that the firmware should be handled by a configuration manager.

The customer suggested that we program the microcontrollers with a bootloader that can download firmware via the CAN-bus. The AT90CAN microcontrollers that we will use have good support for bootloaders so that was the method we agreed upon.
