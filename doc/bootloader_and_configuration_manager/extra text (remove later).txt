introduction
The goals we received and why they're important

The customer gave us two requirements for how to handle the firmware.

The first was that the firmware (Software for the micro controllers) should be downloaded via the CAN-bus. The second that the firmware should be handled by a configuration manager.

The customer suggested that we program the micro controllers with a bootloader. AT90CAN micro controllers that we will use have good support for bootloaders so that was the agreed method.
