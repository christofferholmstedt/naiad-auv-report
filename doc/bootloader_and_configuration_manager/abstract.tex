\begin{abstract}
The customer requests that the microcontrollers should be able to download new firmware via the CAN-bus. This is achieved by installing a bootloader in each microcontroller. The bootloader receives CAN messages containing hex data and programs it into the microcontroller's flash memory. The data is sent from a configuration manager that takes the contents of hex files and embeds the data into CAN messages. Since Naiad has several microcontrollers the configuration manager also keeps track of programmable microcontrollers.
