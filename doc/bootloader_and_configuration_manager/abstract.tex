\begin{abstract}
The customer requested that the microcontrollers should be able to download new firmware via the CAN-bus. This is achieved by installing a bootloader in each microcontroller. The bootloader receives CAN messages containing hex data and programs it into the microcontroller's flash memory. The data is sent from a configuration manager that takes the contents of hex files and embeds the data into CAN messages. Since the Naiad AUV has several microcontrollers the configuration manager also keeps track of each microcontroller.
