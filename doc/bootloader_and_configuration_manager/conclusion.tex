\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:method}, there was a problem with using the weRobot bootloader. This bootloader was adapted into AVR Studio instead of IAR Embedded Workbench. If the problem could be fixed then there is no need to use the IAR Embedded Workbench which requires the user to sign up for a time-limited license which is undesirable.

It should be possible to connect from the PC to the beaglebone with websockets and make a configuration manager in a browser. The good thing about this is that it would remove some of the uncertainties on which operative systems and environments that the configuration manager can run on.
