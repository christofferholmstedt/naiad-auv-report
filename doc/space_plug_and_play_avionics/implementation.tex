\subsection{Virtual Plug-and-Play Network}
\subsubsection{Design}
The goal with the first implementation was to test the capabilities of VPPN.
This included basic infrastructure such as a data manager, a CAN Bus
gateway, an application (a consumer of data) and a service provider. Figure
\ref{fig:vppn-overview} shows the basic components needed and how they are
interconnected.

    \label{fig:vppn-overview}
\end{figure}

Each component's responsibility is described in the following list and an
example connecting all components together after that.
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\em Data Manager} keeps track of all connected components in the VPPN
        network and which interfaces they have.
    \item {\em Application (consumer)} uses data supplied by the service
        provider.
    \item {\em Service Provider} could be a sensor of some kind that
        applications can subsribe to for reguarly updates of the sensor value.
    \item {\em VPPN-CAN Gateway} routes traffic from the local subnet in the
        processing unit to the CAN Bus local subnet.
\end{itemize}

In a fully operational VPPN network adress resolution and initial
configuration is partly done by other components not used in this minimal
design, for the minimal implementation hardcoded settings were planned instead.
After initial configuration each component sends information to the
data manager in the format of "Extensible Transducer Electronic Data Sheets"
(xTEDS) which is a XML file with a predefined structure. This file includes
respective components capabilities and must be created when the component is
constructed (it should be stored together with the component it describes).

The Data Manager then goes through all xTEDS to find out which components wants
information from other components. The Data Manager in the minimal
implementation would find that the "Application" wants sensor information of
the same type the Service Provider supply. The Data Manager would then report
back to the Application with information that the Application should contact
the Service Provider. The Application would then subscribe to the Service
Provider's sensor information in a peer to peer manner.

Whenever the Service Provider (Sensor) on the CAN Bus network were to communicate
with another component outside of the CAN Bus network the VPPN-CAN Gateway
needs to do routing. To be able to do this routing the VPPN-CAN Gateway is also
responsible for the adress resolution in the boot up phase for the CAN Bus.

\subsubsection{VPPN and CAN Bus}
In the minimal design the VPPN-CAN Gateway component runs on the same
processing unit as the Mission Control System and connects with other
components on that local subnet through UDP/IP through the loopback interface.

In a VPPN network each component both hardware and software must have a unique
address. When starting the system the responsiblity of the VPPN-CAN Gateway is to
enumerate the CAN Bus for all connected components and assign a local address to
each one. This contradicts the behaviour of the CAN Bus which is message based
and not address based. As per request from the customer the project went
forward with the minimal implementation design without putting to much attention to
the contradiction.

First issue to solve is the assignment of addresses. In IP networks and SPA Local
Subnets a common address is used to make the network manager aware of the newly
connected component. For IP networks newly connected network devices sends a
broadcast message to all other devices on the same local network with it's own
address as 0.0.0.0 (IPv4). The DHCP server then replies with a response that
includes a new IP address the device can use. In the SPA Local Subnet
Adaptation Draft newly started processes sends a message to the loopback
interface with port 3500 requesting an address. Together with the request for a
new address a unique identifier is included in the message (e.g. MAC Address
for IPv4 networks).

Applying the same behaviour to the CAN Bus would cause the CAN Bus to
malfunction due to collision errors when multiple CAN hosts transmit the same
message ID but with different payload (including the unique identifier).
This is the same bootstraping problem others have tried to solve with
"IP over CAN".
