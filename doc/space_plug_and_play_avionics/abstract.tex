    Space plug-and-play Avionics technology can easily be adapted to other
    fields such as autonomous underwater vehicles. During the "Naiad project"
    an initial attempt was made to do this. This report goes through the
    basics of Space plug-and-play Avionics, the derivative work of "Virtual
    Plug-and-Play Network" and the problems experienced throughout the project.

    In the end the problems were to big to solve during the project so support
    for Space plug-and-play Technology was dropped. Conclusions presented
    focuses mainly on future work.
