\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The approach taken during the Naiad project started from the solution presented
from Ditze et. al. This approach seemed to have some good features to it. Among
others the 10 bits prioritisation band seemed to be usefull for systems with
hard real-time requirements. In the end it turned out that the same
prioritisation band might be too big.
