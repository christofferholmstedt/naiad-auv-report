As a part of the Space plug-and-play Avionics requirement one part turned out
to focus on IP over CAN.

\subsection{Internet Protocol (IP)}
The Internet Protocol is the main protocol for addressing different hosts on a
single or across multipe link networks. Internet Protocol version 4 is the
version currently most users use but with no more addresses available
for new devices a move to Internet Protocol version 6 is currently ongoing.

\subsubsection{IP version 4 (IPv4)}
IPv4 originally defined as a standard in September 1981 \cite{web:rfc791} has
seen a few updates throughout the years. The core part is that each host
connected to a network has a 32 bit address. For human readability this address
is often written in decimal form as four octets (e.g. 192.168.0.1).

As the number of connected devices grew more than expected in the nineteen-nineties
"Network Address Translation" (NAT) was introduced to limit the number of
publically accessible IP addresses assigned and improve routing for Internet
Service Providers \cite{web:rfc1631, web:rfc1918, web:rfc3022}.

One of the most common ways to assign IP addresses on a network is through the
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) \cite{web:rfc2131, web:rfc2132, web:rfc4361}.
When a host connects to the network, the client, it sends a DHCP request and the DHCP
server(s) available on the network replies back with a DHCP offer with a free
IP address the new host can use. As identification the client use either its
MAC Address or another client identification value depending of version of the
protocol that is used. After this process end-to-end communication is possible
within the network.

\subsubsection{IP version 6 (IPv6)}
IPv6 was first specified as proposed standard RFC 1883 \cite{web:rfc1883} in
December 1995 now obsoleted by RFC 2460 \cite{web:rfc2460}. The motiviation for
its creation is that it was in the end of nineteen-eighties apparent that the
IPv4 address space was too small. Instead of the 32 bits address in IPv4 an
IPv6 address consists of 128 bits. For human readability this address is often
written in hexadecimal form in 8 groups seperated by colons
(e.g. 2a00:860:0340:aabf:aabf:baad:3423:0495). RFC 5952 \cite{web:rfc5952}
defines recommended text representation of IPv6 addresses.
