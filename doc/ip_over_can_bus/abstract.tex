\begin{abstract}
    The Internet Protocol (IP) is a connection oriented communication protocol
    based on the idea that all hosts have an address and communication is done
    by end-to-end communication. Controller Area Network is a message oriented
    protocol where all hosts connected to a single CAN Bus can read everything
    and often write back to.

    As the world moves towards IP based communication for Internet of Things
    it's worth looking into if IP can be adapted to work across a CAN Bus. This
    report goes through what has been done in the Naiad project and what future
    work should be undertaken. In the end IP over CAN was not used in the
    final AUV.
